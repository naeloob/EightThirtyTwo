DONE Look at potential little endian mode

DONE Add another overloaded instruction for a halfword modifier

DONE Implement interrupts

* Look at fusing mr with li, and potentially addt.

* Results forwarding?

* GHDL - can we integrate a proper UART emulation and print results to the Shell window?

* Look at multithreading.  Would need a second register file, a second PC and a second fetch channel.
  The second thread would launch with the C flag set, so startup code can tell whether it's dealing with
  Thread 1, Thread 2 or an interrupt.

* C backend - get signed-ness, composite types and halfword / byte operations working.
